#Objective


Develop and deploy a frontend application that uses the backend you’ve developed to process the input and
get response, then render it on frontend. (Preferably React based – including frameworks like Next.js, but
that’s optional).

#Logic

1. The application should have a text input that accepts JSONs that are from the previous section’s
(backend’s) request. Example - { "data": ["A",”C”,”z”] }
2. The frontend application should call the REST API that you’ve created to process the data in request
and return the response as per the logic mentioned in backend challenge.
